TITLE: Google Class Reference for Image Scraping

Description: Google uses really weird class names on their search result pages. This .txt is a reference to the names of those classes encountered throughout building the image scraper. 

GUIDE (NOTE: Get values from Selenium's chrome window as usual chrome has different values):

1.A.(NOT WORKING!) Google Search Results Image Button - home result page for any term's "Image" button, that takes you from the home page to the google images page.

Class of "Image" button: cDaxAd

1.B. (WORKS!) ABOVE ISN'T WORKING, NEED TO GET VALUES FROM SELENIUM RUN CHROME BROWSER!
BELOW IS FOR GOOGLE "IMAGES" BUTTON IN MAIN SEARCH RESULTS PAGE

SELECTOR
#hdtb-msb > div:nth-child(1) > div > div:nth-child(2) > a

FULL XPATH
/html/body/div[7]/div/div[4]/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/div/div[2]/a

XPATH
//*[@id="hdtb-msb"]/div[1]/div/div[2]/a

2. Google Image Search "Show more results" button

Value (use value here) of above button: value="Show more results"

3. Google Image Search (WORKS) - Xpath for first image, since we need to click on first image to get access to full size photos on google images. 

FULL XPATH:
/html/body/div[2]/c-wiz/div[3]/div[1]/div/div/div/div[1]/div[1]/span/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/a[1]/div[1]/img

4. REALLY USEFUL - URL for google image search - append query to end of URL with format "search+next+blah" e.g. to google image search for mt hood do "mt+hood". Here is the URL:
https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1873&bih=990&q=
